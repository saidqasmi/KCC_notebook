Requirements
------------

- Clone the repository:

<code>git clone git@gitlab.com:saidqasmi/KCC_notebook.git</code>

- Install the KCC R package 

Follow the instructions available at: <a href="https://gitlab.com/saidqasmi/KCC">https://gitlab.com/saidqasmi/KCC</a> 

- If necessary, install the Jupyter Notebook interface

Follow the official documentation to install the interface: <a href="https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/notebook-classic.html">https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/notebook-classic.html</a>

Install the R kernel for Jupyter Notebook by running the following command in a R console:

<code>install.packages("IRkernel")</code>

Make the kernel available to Jupyter by running in a R console (if you have root access, set `user = FALSE`):
<code>IRkernel::installspec(user = TRUE)</code>
